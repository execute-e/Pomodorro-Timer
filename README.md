<h1>Pomodoro timer</h1>
<p>This is my second project. I used HTML, CSS, and JS here.</p>
<p>There are 2 inputs, timer, and buttons. U can change work time and break time, start timer, pause timer, continue timer, reset timer.</p>
<p>Also, when the cycle of timers changes, the color of the timer changes. The break timer is green, the work timer is blue. This can be understood by the colors of the values ​​in the inputs</p>
<p>The project is completed. More features will be added here over time.</p>
<p>A little bit from me: this project was quite difficult for me, I developed it much longer than the last one (<a href="https://github.com/execute-e/To-do-List">To-do list</a>). But I managed to finish it, and learned a lot of new things in the process of debugging.</p>
